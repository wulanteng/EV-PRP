# EV-PRP Data and Results

This repository contains the benchmark instances and computational results used in the experiments for the pollution-routing problem for electric vehicles (EV-PRP).

## Folder Structure

- `Instances/` contains the benchmark instances used in the experiments, categorized into small-, medium-, and large-size instances.
- `Results/` contains the corresponding computational results, including both the baseline experiments and the sensitivity analysis, organized by instance size.

## Notes
- The organization of instances and results follows the experimental setup reported in the paper.
- Detailed descriptions of instance generation, parameter settings, and performance metrics are provided in the paper.
